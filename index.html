    <h1>Birds in the park</h1>
    <h3><a href="./images/img-1.jpg" target="_blank">Red & White-winged Crossbills</a></h3>

    <p>Finding <a href="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Red_Crossbill/id" target="_blank">Red Crossbills</a> and <a href="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Red_Crossbill/id" target="_blank">White-Winged Crossbills</a> is one challenge — the second is getting close enough to actually to see their twisted bills, which they use to prize seeds out of pine cones. Males of both species are a brilliant scarlet, while the females are olive green. You can tell them apart by the white dappling on the wings (called wing bars), on the White-Winged Crossbill.Both species are found year-round throughout the Rockies, and throughout the mid to northern U.S. in the winter. Listen closely if you happen upon a flock of Red Crossbills — the species has 10 distinct call-types, and different sub-populations specialize on different types of conifers.</p>
    <h3><a href="./images/img-2.jpg" target="_blank">Northern Goshawk</a></h3>
    <img src="./images/img-2.jpg" alt="img-2" width="150px">
    <p>Few Northern American raptor species are as likely to initiate a tick-the-bird-or-die-trying twitch like the <a href="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Red_Crossbill/id" target="_blank">Northern Goshawk</a> . The largest North American accipiter, these powerful, elusive hawks hunt rabbits, hares, squirrels, and other large birds in dense forests, zipping through the trees at high speeds. They’re found year-round throughout the Rockies, and throughout the mid to northern U.S. in the winter. Adults are distinctive, with heavily barred chests, steel grey back and wings, and deep red eyes. But be careful — juvenile goshawks look similar to Coopers and Sharp-Shinned hawks.</p>
    <h3><a href="./images/img-3.jpg" target="_blank">Snow Bunting</a></h3>
    <img src="./images/img-3.jpg" alt="img-3" width="150px">
    <p>The subtly beautiful, sparrow-sized <a href="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Red_Crossbill/id" target="_blank">Snow Bunting</a> breeds on the high Arctic tundra, where they nest in rock crevices lined with feathers, fur, grass, and moss. Their winter range extends to the northern half of the U.S., where they’re often seen foraging in flocks in snowy winter fields. Male Snow Buntings have to put in a bit of work to achieve their striking black-and-white breeding plumage. After their late summer molt, the plumage on their back and wings is brownish-black. Males wear off the brown-colored feather tips by rubbing themselves against the snow, resulting in pure-black coloration by the time the breeding seasons starts.</p>
    <h3><a href="./images/img-4.jpg" target="_blank">Evening Grosbeak</a></h3>
    <img src="./images/img-4.jpg" alt="img-4" width="150px">
    <p>Garish, unmistakable, and awesome — meet the <a href="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Red_Crossbill/id" target="_blank">Evening Grosbeak</a> . Like the crossbills, these finches of the northern conifer forests often “irrupt” father south into the continental U.S. in winter in search of food. Flocks are common at feeders, where you can get an up-close look at their gaudy coloration: Males are an eye-popping yellow, with black swings, and a bold eyebrow. Females are more subdued, but have a fantastic, green-colored beak.</p>
